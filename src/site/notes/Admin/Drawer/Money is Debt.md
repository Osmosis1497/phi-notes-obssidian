## Lecture: Money is Debt

- Graeber, David. [Money Talks](../../Research/Reading%20Notes/graeberMoneyTalks2011.md), c. 2011

> This is a great little talk on what money really is and why realizing that it is "just a promise" means that the terms can be re-negotiated at any time, just like most other promises. Why people with a lot of money can re-negotiate things with one another.[^1]
