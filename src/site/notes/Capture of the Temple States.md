### Cont
>[!Annotation|#2ea8e5]+ 
>According to Deimel 3), when the Sumerians first settled in southern Mesopotamia, they had to irrigate their agricultural lands because of inadequate annual rainfall and unpredictable flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates. To construct and maintain the necessary irrigation works, labor of the entire population was needed. Land could be exploited e?ciently only of it was considered property of the gods, rather than of individuals or families. In the last quarter of the third millennium B.C., secularizing tendencies caused the Sumerian theocratic order to disintegrate. This order, Deimel thought, was replaced by an allencompassing state organization that closely regulated the economy, much as the temples had done. (p [2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSX2ZGC6?page=2&annotation=RH32GYG9).)

>[!Annotation|#a28ae5]+ 
>A modified version of this hypothesis was set forth in an influential essay by Adam Falkenstein 4). He was convinced that the development of civilization in Mesopotamia was closely connected with the growth of temples. According to him, this led naturally to the creation of a temple-centered state. This temple state was peculiarly Sumerian, he believed, and it existed in one form or another throughout the third millennium B.C., with a brief "interruption" at the time of the Sargonic empire. Ultimately, under the kings of Ur, it evolved into a state-managed economy. As for the details of the temple-state organization, Falkenstein accepted Deimel's conclusions with little change and wrote as follows: As the immediate result of the fact that the temples were the sole or in any case the major land holders, they disposed of the combined labor forces of the city state. Only this condition permitted the cultivation of temple lands, the creation and maintenance of irrigation works, the security measures such as the defense works of cities and the recruiting of troops, and finally the building projects in the sanctuaries themselves 5).

>The importance of irrigation and water control in Mesopotamian history has often been stressed, especially by proponents of the "hydraulic state", an early version of which may be seen in Deimel's hypothesis 1). Archeological survey in Mesopotamia has shown, however, that large-scale irrigation works are known in Mesopotamia only long after autocratic government and complex bureaucracy had evolved 8). No causal connection, therefore, between regulation of water resources and despotic or theocratic rule can plausibly be traced. All, or nearly all, land in southern Mesopotamia was considered by the inhabitants to be the property of gods. (p [4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSX2ZGC6?page=4&annotation=CLDWCPDQ).)

>[!Annotation|#ffd400]+ 
>Diakonoff concluded that although the temples were of major economic importance, they were by no means the only land holders and did not comprise, as Deimel believed, the majority of the population of the state, but an example of but one specific type of "household" economy of the place and period.

>Uruinimgina himself stated that the former practices dated back to time immemorial. This important piece of information, ironically one of the clearest passages in the text, shows that he did not consider the "abuses" short-lived aberrations. This (p [11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSX2ZGC6?page=11&annotation=ZILITF6I).)

>Before Uruinimgina's time, nig-en-na land was referred to as the property of the city ruler's wife, and, more important, extensive areas of it were designated "for the maintenance of the city ruler" and apparently for his wife as well 44).
