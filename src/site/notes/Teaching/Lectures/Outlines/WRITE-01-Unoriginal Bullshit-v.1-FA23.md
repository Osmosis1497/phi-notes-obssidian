## Overview

1. Our philosophical process.
	1. No bullshit.
	2. Propose arguments to think through.
	3. Adopt a fallibilist stance (have good reasons for positions, but revise them when better arguments are made.)
	4. Helpful to use a shared vocabulary to discuss the merits of arguments.
			1. Go over Toulmin model of argumentation. [[Teaching/Lectures/Whiteboards/CARD-Parts of the Toulmin Model\|CARD-Parts of the Toulmin Model]] Use it for criticizing and forming arguments throughout the class.
		1. Go over [[Teaching/Lectures/Whiteboards/Card-Types of Value\|Card-Types of Value]] as a way of organizing how we talk about types of value and how to keep from conflating them.
		2. [[Teaching/Lectures/Whiteboards/CARD - Three Strong Criteria for Truth\|CARD - Three Strong Criteria for Truth]] as a way of evaluating claims.
		3. The [[Research/Ideas/Tensions in Philosophy\|Tensions in Philosophy]] will haunt us the entire class, but also be fertile ground for paper topics.

## Frankfurt on Bullshit

Difference between

- Truth
- Lies
- Bullshit[^1]

## Philosophy as Bold and Critical Play

- [[PHI-02-Philosophy and Critical Thinking as Clarification and Play-v.2.1-FA23.canvas|PHI-02-Philosophy and Critical Thinking as Clarification and Play-v.2.1-FA23]]
- Be bold and propose new combinations of old ideas.
- Don't cop out with wishy-washy positions. Get over the fact that “people disagree” and get on with your argument.

## Be Unoriginal, but Don't Cheat

- Don't make the paper harder than it needs to be.
- You aren't expected to reinvent the wheel
- You do need to know what you are talking about
- Give your take on people's positions after talking about them.
- Assemble something new out of other people's ideas, like Legos
- Why the [[Teaching/Course Outlines/Annie Bib Worksheet 1-Assignment-v.0.75-FA23\|Annie Bib Worksheet 1-Assignment-v.0.75-FA23]] is so important

Three Strong Criteria for Truth ^E4t6PcYI

2. Coherence Criterion ^3R3kijpr

1. Correspondence Criterion ^czi2N096

3. Pragmatic Criterion ^83bZ6Rey

Truth is a matter of finding a fit.

Statement is likely true if fit in with the other claims in a system of other statements.

Metaphor: Puzzle & its Pieces ^Wxz0EUEc

Truth is a mirror of nature.

Statement is true if it accurately reflects the world-as-it-is or substances.

Example: The Cup of [REDACTED]. ^K0CYTgXE

At a minimum, truth should work.

A statement can be considered true if it helps us predict phenomena or otherwise helps us cope with existence.

Example: Directions to School, Kuhn's Scientific Revolutions ^cnERtSTS
