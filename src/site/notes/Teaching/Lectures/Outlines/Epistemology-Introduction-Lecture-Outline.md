# **What Epistemology Studies**  
## Conceptual Analysis and Counterexamples**
- One of the main questions within epistemology pertains to the nature of the concepts of _knowledge, justification,_ and _truth_.
- In doing conceptual analysis, theorists actively endeavor to come up with counterexamples to a proposed definition. A counterexample is a case that illustrates that a statement, definition, or argument is flawed. 
- If a counterexample works to defeat an analysis, then theorists will amend the analysis, offer a new definition, and the process starts over again. 

## Truth
- Philosophers who argue that knowledge of the external world is impossible do so based on the idea that people can never be certain of the truth of their external world beliefs.
- People do not each personally get to decide whether a statement is true.
- Aristotle claimed that a true statement is one that says of something that _it is what it is_ or that _it is not what it is not_. 
- Another way of understanding truth is that it is a correspondence between statements and the world. The correspondence theory of truth is that a statement is true if and only if that statement corresponds to some fact (Marian 2015).      

# **Knowledge** 
## Plato and the Traditional Account of Knowledge
- Plato hypothesized that knowledge was justified, true belief. Plato’s analysis is known as the traditional account of knowledge. It is often referred to as the JTB account (because it is “justified true belief”).
- Plato’s definition is that a person _S_ knows proposition _P_ if and only if
	1. _P_ is true,
	2. _S_ believes _P_, and
	3. _S_ is justified in believing _P_.                                         

## Fixing Plato’s Traditional Account of Knowledge
- •Gettier cases demonstrate that Plato’s traditional account of knowledge as justified true belief is wrong.
	- Notice that this does not mean that belief, truth, or justification are not _necessary_ for knowledge.
- Accordingly, attempts to solve the Gettier problem do one of two things:
	1. They replace the justification condition with something more robust, or 
	2. They add a fourth condition to JTB to make the account sufficient.  

  ### No False Premises
- American philosopher Gilbert Harman (1973) suggested adding a condition to the JTB account that he terms “no false lemmas.” A false lemma is false premise/step in the reasoning process. 
- However, the account cannot take care of all Gettier cases. Consider the case of Henry in fake barn country. His inference flows directly from his perceptual experience of a real barn. Yet, it is a matter of luck that Henry wasn’t looking at one of the many barn facades in the area, and so his belief still does not seem to count as knowledge.

### Ruling Out Defeaters and Alternatives

- Contemporary American philosophers Keith Lehrer and Thomas Paxson Jr. (1969) suggested that justified, true belief is knowledge so long as there are no existing defeaters of the belief. 

- We are told that a defeater is evidence that _would_ undermine a person's justification, but not how it does this.

- Notice that what counts as a defeater depends upon what that justification is: a defeater is evidence that would undermine a person’s justification.
 
## The Problem with “*Justification”

- “Justification” is a rather broad concept. Instead of simply stating that justification is necessary for knowledge, perhaps a thorough account of knowledge ought to instead spell out what this means.

### An Example of Internalism: Ruling Out Relevant Alternatives

- We could say that _S_ needs to rule out any relevant alternatives to their belief. 

- The “no relevant alternatives” theory adds to the traditional account of knowledge the requirement that a person rule out any competing hypotheses for their belief. 

- However, it still doesn’t solve the Gettier problem. Returning to the barn example, the possibility that there are barn facades is not a relevant alternative to the belief that one is looking at a barn. Unless one is in Hollywood, they would not think that facades are a distinct possibility.  

**7.3 Justification**

**An Example of Externalism: Causal Theories** 

•        Externalists hold that people need not have access to why their true beliefs are justified.

•        Goldman argues that beliefs are justified if they are produced by reliable belief-forming processes. Importantly, it is the process that confers justification and not one’s ability to recount that process. 

•        Goldman’s theory is called **historical reliabilism**.

•        Reliable belief-forming processes include perception, memory, strong or valid reasoning, and introspection.

•        Consider again Henry and the barn. Henry looks at a real barn and forms the belief that it is a barn. Henry’s belief that he’s looking at a barn is caused by a reliable belief-forming process (perception). And so according to Goldman’s account, Henry does have knowledge. 



**7.4 Skepticism**

**The Evil Demon Argument**

- [[Whiteboards/Descartes Whiteboard\|Descartes argues]] that because dreams often incorporate experiences people have in real life, it is impossible to distinguish between dreaming and waking life.

- Descartes devises an even stronger skeptical hypothesis: What if people are being tricked by an evil demon?  

- If people cannot reliably tell the difference between experiences caused by reality and experiences caused by an evil demon, then they cannot know anything. 



**7.5 Applied Epistemology** 

**Social Epistemology - Group Justification** 

- When can it rightfully be said that a group believes something? One answer is that a group believes _P_ only in cases in which all or almost all members of the group believe _P_. However, one does attribute a belief to a group while not always assuming every member holds the belief. 

- If groups are capable of beliefs, then clearly the question of justification of group belief is relevant.
