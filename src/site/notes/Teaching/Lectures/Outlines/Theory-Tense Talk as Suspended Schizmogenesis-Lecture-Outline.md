## Proposal

*Based upon [[Teaching/Lectures/elements/unreviewed/-Lecture-Presentation-Notes\|-Lecture-Presentation-Notes]], given on 10/23/2022*

## Central Idea

- Trauma vocabularies and strategies might help us imagine way to help students unwind emerging and long-standing "culture zones."

### Key Notions

- Schizmogenesis as the dis-integration of a society into culture zones
- Trauma as the dis-integration of the mind and body

## Discussion: Where do we go from here?

- Discussion: Developing a vocabulary of challenging care in our classes and societies
	1. For the trauma survivors in our communities
	2. For the schizmogenesis our students identify and participate within

### First Stop at the Imagination Station:

Can we say the following?

- We are uniquely positioned in society to sit down with cross-section of our communities, occasion them to reflect on themselves and their communities both in terms of the traumas endured and the possible schizmogenesis.
- Our students are likewise uniquely positioned in society to see and respond to this dis-integration.

> 1. What might something helpful in your classroom look like?
>
> 2. What pitfalls you can imagine?
>
> 3. Whether it would be worth it to try and to try to minimize the pitfalls?
>
> 4. Does the Rorty quote on redescription capture what invisible cruelty might look like in our classrooms?
