> All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind. [(A. Smith 1776)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wiEZCY)

Historically, scholars, theologians, and states have used “religious studies” as a tool to measure, abstract, and manage other humans. To illustrate, let's look at “Moral and Political Chart of the Known World”, an incredibly dense map from 1845 by W. C. Woodbridge. To do so, we’ll need to take in the map as a whole and decode the legend. This’ll help explain what happened along the eastern coast of southern Cape of Africa. With these more somber confessions in place, we’ll conclude by challenging ourselves to imagine something better.

When someone asks a mapmaker to make them a map, each line, shape, color, and name will have a set of reasons behind it, all adding up to why the map was made.  Puzzling out that purpose might tell us something about what else was going on.

And with that, let’s zoom in on the legend.

Many questions come to mind here, starting with “what in the world?”. But let’s focus on why Woodbridge thought this was a moral map of the world---after all, the full name of the map is Moral and Political Chart of the Inhabited World - Exhibiting the Prevailing Religion, Form of Government, Degree of Civilization, and Population of Each Country. Quite the map of ambition---and racism as it turns out.  What is the deal with the clear ranking of degree of civilization and why are six religions represented, three of which are various forms of the same religion?

In the biz, these are called “**hierarchies of exclusion**,” made to fit together by **sovereign powers**.[(Katz 2015)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nZMMYP)  On our map, Turgot's hierarchy of societal forms is joined to Tiele’s **hierarchy of religious form**s, which were formulated in part as a response to what’s known as “**the indigenous critique**” of Europe. [(Wengrow and Graeber 2021; J. Z. Smith 1998, 280)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ogdnBv) The key bit here is that these forms were assumed by the professor, priest, and prince to be more or less natural or enculturated traits, rendering the peoples they encountered as in need of “saving” by means of North Atlantic approaches to religion and politics.

If you are interested in how this worked, David Chidester’s Savage Systems shows how the Dutch and English invaders denied --- but then discovered ---the very capacity for religion among the Xhosa-speaking peoples of the Cape of Africa several times.  This intellectual warbling suspiciously mirrored how smoothly things were going for the occupiers at the time. [(Chidester 1996)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?QUR90q)  More generally though, the “Masters of Mankind” Adam Smith warned us about used similar reasoning to justify class, gender, racial, and other power imbalances, which have disastrously reformatted so much of the world since. [(A. Smith 1776; Suzie et al. 2014; Mills 1997; Pateman 1988; Bayyah et al. 2006)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GfUg4T)

With this in mind, we can see why scholars like Korzybski and J.Z. Smith are quick to point out that "[[map is not territory\|map is not territory]]”! [(Korzybski 1933; J. Z. Smith 1978)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?vJcNg4) 

Maps sometimes show us a[[ dark mirror\| dark mirror]] of ourselves--Woodbridge's map certainly does for the North Atlantic study of religion. As someone trained within this tradition, it can be difficult to navigate and grapple with the complex history that helped set the stage for some of the challenges the world faces today. Having realized many of our prior base assumptions about hierarchies of humanity were just plain wrong, the discipline has been working through such assumptions in both theory and fieldwork.

Trying to describe a singular essence of religion doesn't seem possible.  In fact, we can’t even really define “religion” in religious studies!  Rather than despair, this might actually free us to use religion as a tool to understand and talk with others about who they are and how they understand and act in the world. [(J. Z. Smith 1998, 278)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?09ZRNd) Returning to our purposes, perhaps speaking in a similar spirit about and with religious others might create the circumstances that can lead to a more hopeful and understanding discussion in our classrooms. Religious studies has come a long way since Woodbridge, but there is still room for improvement. 

And who knows?  Perhaps we might even experience the social pleasures of getting to know one another along the way. 🙂
