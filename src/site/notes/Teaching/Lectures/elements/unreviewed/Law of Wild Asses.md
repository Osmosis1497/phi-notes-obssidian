# Definition
From the Jesuit Relations 12:191-2.  
> All these barbarians have the law of wild asses - they are born, live, and die in liberty without restraint; they do not know what it is meant by bridle or bit.  With them, to conquer one's passions is a great joke, while to to five free rein to the enses is a lofty philosophy.[^1]

# Questions: 
> Is this a helpful definition of sorts for freedom?
> How might this help inform us about Jesuit thinking about freedom---both as a concept and the evaluation of that concept?
>How does getting a sense of the Jesuit notions help us understand what else might have been going on on the frontier of Amerindian and French society as well as within each at the time?
