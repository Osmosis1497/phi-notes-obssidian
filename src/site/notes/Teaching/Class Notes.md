## Purpose

This is used to haphazardly house notes and artifacts discussed in class. These can be maps, letters to the US president, quotations, diagrams for in-class-thought experiments, and so forth. This is not used to publish general class notes.

*Fig 1: Map of [Arcadia](WB-TE-Rawls-Case%201-Irrigation%20Network%201.md), used in the thought experiment on Rawls.*

Keep in mind that mere *presence* of an idea or source here is in not an indication of endorsement or criticism of it. This is merely a way to easily share content in class.

Source are cited and linked when possible. Please contact me if you find something amiss. If you provide some sources and are convincing, I'll certainly update things.

## In-Class Notes

Below are *some* of the notes we used in class this semester.

- [Selected Whiteboards](Selected%20Whiteboards.md) [^1] - Below are some screencaps of whiteboards used in class. Feel free to OCR or otherwise recreate and remix.
- [Selected Outlines](Lectures/Outlines/Selected%20Outlines.md) [^2] - Below are various outlines used in class. Do not consider them *holistic* examinations of the topic, but instead what we highlighted or used as artifacts for discussion in class.
- [Selected Lit Notes](../Research/Reading%20Notes/Selected%20Lit%20Notes.md) [^3] - These are my Zotero literature (reading) notes from selected sources I sometimes reference in class. The quotations in the lit. notes are highlights and comments from PDFs and aren't necessarily a good guide to the work as a whole. Provide this to encourage students to double-check and expand upon the resources in class for their own papers Literature notes are titled by citation key.

### Helpful Tools

Here are some great learning tools.

- [Personal Whiteboard - Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) - You can use this to take notes locally on your computer. Notes can be stored in a excalidraw file or quickly exported to images.
- [Personal Wiki - Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - You can easily create a second-brain of notes. You literally build your own wikipedia out of simple text notes. Makes writing a breeze if you use Ahren's strategy here: [Notetaking method I use in my PhD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SLlxaEEXY)
- [Research Manager - Zotero](https://zotero.org) - One-stop location for all your research needs, including citations, PDF management, and notes.
