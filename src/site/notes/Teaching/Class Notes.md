# Purpose
This is used to house artifacts discussed in class.  These can be maps, letters to the US president, quotations, diagrams for in-class-thought experiments, and so forth.  This is not used to publish general class notes.

Keep in mind that mere *presence* of an idea or source here is in *no way* an indication of endorsement or criticism.  Merely things we examine or deconstruct on our way to trying make sense of our current one and perhaps imagine something better. 

 Source are cited and linked when possible.  Please contact me if you find something amiss. If you provide some sources and are convincing, I'll certainly update things.

# Notes by Class
When published, each class will have a general outline. When appropriate, links to additional readings, whiteboards, etc will be provided.

- Sample

# Reading Notes
These are my Zotero literature (reading) notes from selected sources I sometimes reference in class.  People are encouraged to double check both the source itself as well as my characterization. Better ones will be adopted. Literature notes are titled by citation key.
