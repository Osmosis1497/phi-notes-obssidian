## Purpose

This is used to haphazardly house notes and artifacts discussed in class. These can be maps, letters to the US president, quotations, diagrams for in-class-thought experiments, and so forth. This is not used to publish general class notes.

Keep in mind that mere *presence* of an idea or source here is in not an indication of endorsement or criticism of it. This is merely a way to easily share content in class.

Source are cited and linked when possible. Please contact me if you find something amiss. If you provide some sources and are convincing, I'll certainly update things.
