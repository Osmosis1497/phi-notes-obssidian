# Purpose
This is used to haphazardly house notes and artifacts discussed in class.  These can be maps, letters to the US president, quotations, diagrams for in-class-thought experiments, and so forth.  This is not used to publish general class notes.

Keep in mind that mere *presence* of an idea or source here is in *no way* an indication of endorsement or criticism of it. This is merely a way to easily share content in class.

Source are cited and linked when possible.  Please contact me if you find something amiss. If you provide some sources and are convincing, I'll certainly update things.

# Selected Whiteboard Screenshots
Below are some screencaps of whiteboards used in class.  Feel free to OCR or otherwise recreate and remix.

# Selected Outlines
Below are various outlines used in class. Do not consider them *holistic* examinations of the topic, but instead what we highlighted or used as artifacts for discussion in class.

# Selected Literature Notes
These are my Zotero literature (reading) notes from selected sources I sometimes reference in class.  The quotations in the lit. notes are highlights and comments from PDFs and aren't necessarily a good guide to the work as a whole.  Provide this to encourage students to double-check and expand upon the resources in class for their own papers Literature notes are titled by citation key.
