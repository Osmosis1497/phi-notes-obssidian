## Summary of Thought Experiment [^1]

> [!thought experiment]+ *octopus test*
>  Two people A and B live alone on remote islands, but communicate with each other in English[1](https://julianmichael.org/blog/2020/07/23/to-dissect-an-octopus.html#fn:bender-rule) text messages through a trans-oceanic cable. A hyper-intelligent Octopus O, sitting on the ocean floor, taps the cable and listens in on their conversations for an indeterminate period. Eventually, O gets lonely and decides to interpose on the conversation, cutting off B and impersonating their replies to A. The question is whether O can keep up the charade indefinitely without eventually raising A’s suspicions.
> 
> - Suppose A constructs a coconut catapult, sends detailed instructions over the wire, and asks for B’s thoughts.
> - Suppose A is suddenly chased by an angry bear, grabs a couple of sticks to defend herself, and asks B for advice.
> 
> Will O be able to provide meaningful feedback in either case, having no grounded experience with coconuts, catapults, bear attacks, or any of the physical, social, and embodied processes and situations involved?

## Terms

> **Form** - Any observable realization of language. For example, marks/words on a page, pixels in an image, movements of hands in sign language or the dashes and dots of Morse code.
> 
> **Communicative Intent** is grounded in the real world that the speaker and listener inhabit together.
> 
> There are many types of communicative intents: they may be to convey some information to the other person; or to ask them to do something; or simply to socialize.
> 
> **Conventional Meaning** of an expression is what is constant across all of it's possible context of use. Conventional meaning is an abstract object that represents the communicative potential of a form, given the linguistic system it is drawn from.
> 
> **Meaning** is the relation between form and communicative intent

### Meaning-Making

> So *meaning* is made up out of two things, an expression of language (*form*) and the communicative intent which may be independent of the form.
> 
> Then to *understand* something is the process of retrieving the *communicative intent* given the *form*.
