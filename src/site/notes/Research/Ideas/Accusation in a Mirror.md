Marcus, Kenneth L. “Accusation in a Mirror.” _Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal_ 43 (2012): 357.

# Core Idea
> The basic idea of AiM is deceptively simple: ==propagandists must "impute to enemies exactly what they and their own party are planning to do." ==
> 
> In other words, AiM is a rhetorical practice in which one falsely accuses one's enemies of conducting, plotting, or desiring to commit precisely the same transgressions that one plans to commit against them. 

# Example
> For example, if one plans to kill one's adversaries by drowning them in a particular river, then one should accuse one's adversaries of plotting precisely the same crime. 
> 
> As a result, one will accuse one's enemies of doing the same thing despite their plans. It is similar to a false anticipatory *tu quoque*: before one's enemies accuse one truthfully, one accuses them falsely of the same misdeed.

# Aims
> The point is not merely to impute iniquities that are as bad as the misdeeds that the propagandist's own party intends. Instead, AiM is the more audacious idea of charging one's adversary with "exactly" the misdeeds that the propagandist's party intends to commit.


# Reading notes

AiM is central to creating the conditions that enable genocide.

Definition of Genocide, which is too narrow.
