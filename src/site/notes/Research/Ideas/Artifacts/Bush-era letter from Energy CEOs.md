## Letter to George W. Bush from Energy and other CEOs
- USCAP, and Parag Chokshi. “Joint Statement of the United States Climate Action Partnership | NRDC.” Organization Site. NRDC, January 20, 2007. [https://web.archive.org/web/20221011230114/https://www.nrdc.org/media/2007/070120](https://web.archive.org/web/20221011230114/https://www.nrdc.org/media/2007/070120).

In 2007, a group of CEOs of major energy and manufacturing companies[^1] & NGOs sent George Bush a letter, set up a marketing and legislative push, and so on to enact a plan to use [[Research/Ideas/Artifacts/State\|State]] [[power\|power]] to *compel* *their own companies and organizations* to 
* act against the logics of the market and
* defy the social consensus that management's purpose is to maximize shareholder profit above all else.

> Toward this end, USCAP urges lawmakers to enact a policy framework for mandatory reductions of GHG emissions from major emitting sectors

And to force them to do so in time to curtail the worst effects of climate change---which they themselves were driving. The found this letter necessary because the current conditions of the market were compelling them to destroy our environment.

> But debate cannot substitute for action. We hope that the consensus we have reached through our unique partnership provides further impetus toward the creation of sensible and effective policies to address global climate change.

Pamphlet put out in 2007 to market USCAP's plan to use State power to create a market for carbon pollution as a profitable means to force them to act on climate change---because market incentives (ultimately accountable to shareholders, for whom CEOs have a legal obligation to maximize profits) will not in time, if ever.
