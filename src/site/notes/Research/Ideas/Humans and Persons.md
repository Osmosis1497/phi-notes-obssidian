# Rough Definitions
- Humans
	- scientific and biological category
- Persons
	- moral and political category

# Problem
> How can we argue for a change in moral status on the basis of biological status without being arbitrary?

# Goal
> Construct a definition of personhood that does not rely on biological distinctiveness.
