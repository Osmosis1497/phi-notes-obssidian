Below are rough diagrams of how bodies were constructed in the minds of Greek and Roman elites---think doctors, philosophers, and senators here.

## Three Sorts of Bodies (Somas) in the Greco-Roman Mind

## Greco-Roman Gender Spectrum
Partially rationalized from the gradations in the quality of "stuff" that made up bodies, below is how the Greco-Roman elites then thought of what masculine and feminine bodies were naturally capable of. This was a spectrum and all persons were thought to have a *degree* of natural flexibility they could cultivate in one direction or another.

The key bit is that these *ideas* about bodies and gender were also imprinted on bodies. We can see this in doctor's prescriptions, athletic training, and even adultery trials.

## Greco-Roman Power Grid

When we map the gender spectrum alongside the class spectrum in ancient Greco-Roman society, we find something like the below in the minds and structures of elite society.

This grid helped them shape and contain the ways everyday people organized themselves in everything from market transactions to sexual practices. Note that the categories themselves only really make sense when you consider from whose perspective all of our source material was written.  Hint, most of them are clustered in the same area of the chart.
