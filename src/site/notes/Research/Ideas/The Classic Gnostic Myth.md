Generally speaking, a lot of gnostic myths involve a divine being *Sophia* who somehow or another creates a demiurge which then turns on Sophia, scattering bits throughout its creation. The savior is sent to liberate the bits of Sophia in some of humanity.

One version of this myth is diagrammed below, from the *Secret Book According to John*. The diagram is from *The Gnostic Scriptures* by Layton, but can also be found in [brakkeGnosticScriptures2021](../Reading%20Notes/brakkeGnosticScriptures2021.md).
