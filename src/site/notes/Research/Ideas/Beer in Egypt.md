From *Dawn of Everything* [^1]

# The New Research
Beer and bread making did not arise out of what we heard growing up. Wheat-beer, and then later wheat-bread, came out of a religious culture of caring for the dead that was later appropriated as a model for venerating and justifying kings.

# The old, old story
Growing up, I heard tell of ancient Egyptian pharoses using wheat-beer to pacify and keep the workers fed.
I later heard (Rousseau) that agriculture is what lead to the "fall" of hunter-gatherers. It allowed for surplus, which lead to
1) hoarding,
- which lead to paying flunkies to keep the poors away from the hoard
- which lead to kings and states that have a monopoly on violence in a given territory (Weber)
as well as
2) over-population
- which led to needing to settle down to keep growing agriculture
- which led to cities
- which needed complex solutions to manage the new technological and social problems
- which led to the legitimacy of the otherwise arbitrary power of command in #1.
  
I also heard in evolutionary psychology and economics classes that hunter-gatherers' lives were centered around maximizing caloric efficiency. Once agriculture was invented, it was quickly adopted everywhere.

# Wider Conclusions

> Caring labor is in a way the very opposite of mechanical labor.

> If.. states really do have common features, one must certainly be a tendency to displace this caring impulse onto abstractions.

 > Popular devotion was diverted onto  grand abstractions, in this case the ruler and elite dead.
