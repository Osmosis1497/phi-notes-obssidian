### Abstract

> Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse). All diagnostic requirements for PTSD are met. In addition, Complex PTSD is characterised by severe and persistent 1) problems in affect regulation; 2) beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the traumatic event; and 3) difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. These symptoms cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.## Citekey

> [!quote] Highlight  
> When parents or caregivers are the source of the trauma (e.g., sexual abuse), children and adolescents often develop a disorganized attachment style that can manifest as unpredictable behaviours towards these individuals (e.g., alternating between neediness, rejection, and aggression). In children less than 5 years old, attachment disturbances related to maltreatment may also include Reactive Attachment Disorder or Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder, which can co-occur with Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

> [!quote] Highlight  
> In older adults, Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder may be dominated by anxious avoidance of thoughts, feelings, memories, and persons as well as physiological symptoms of anxiety (e.g., enhanced startle reaction, autonomic hyperreactivity). Affected individuals may experience intense regret related to the impact of traumatic experiences on their lives.
