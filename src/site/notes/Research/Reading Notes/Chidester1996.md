## Abstract
> This essay focuses upon a single object, a shipwrecked anchor that was washed ashore on the eastern Cape coast of southern Africa. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, European travellers, missionaries, and magistrates cited this anchor as evidence of religion among indigenous people in the region. By the end of the century, however, this same anchor was being used by metropolitan theorists as a classic piece of evidence for the origin of religion. By recounting the strange story of this anchor, I hope to recover a history (or prehistory) of the study of religion in three phases—frontier, imperial and apartheid—that have defined the practice of comparative religion from a southern African perspective.## Citekey

> [!quote] Highlight
> At every stage in its history, however, the anchor marked significant theoretical oppositions in comparative religion. Perhaps originally used to signal an indigenous African distinction between sea and land, the anchor was subsequently employed by European comparativists to mark oppositions between religion and superstition, the civilized and the primitive, and, ultimately, the opposition between a scientific rationality and an abstracted, disembodied and decontextualized ‘primitive mentality’ that was out of touch with the real world.
