## Abstract
> Scholars have long sought for the origins of modern states in antiquity, with ancient Egypt serving as a prototype of “the archaic state.” Drawing on ideas in my recent book with David Graeber, The Dawn of Everything (L’alba di tutto), my lecture will present an alternative thesis. Rather than being a deeply rooted political form, the modern state may instead be regarded as a recent convergence of three different principles of social power: sovereignty, competitive politics (e.g. elections), and bureaucracy. An archaeological perspective suggests that these three principles of organised power have distinct origins and often appeared independently or in tension with each other. This may provide a more compelling way to understand the variety of political forms in the human past, than searching for “the origins of the state”.
