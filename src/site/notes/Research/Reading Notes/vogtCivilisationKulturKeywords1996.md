> Since the growing number of migrants is visibly reshaping these populations, countries are forced to deal with the changing nature of their constituencies. At the same time, states with varying national interests must seek common policies for coping with migration in the name of international cooperation. But while policy on immigration becomes more of an international decision, the issue of citizenship still falls to individual states.
>> Immigration is merely a problem for states as such, not humanity as such.

> As Rogers Brubaker notes, ’in the European setting, citizenship stands out as the last bastion of sovereignty’,’ as other domains of state power diminish. Citizenship is important in that it defines who can or who cannot be a member of a particular state. It is tied up with the politics of identity and with notions of membership in the nation.
