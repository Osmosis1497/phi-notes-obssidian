It poses the question: why do some of us still work until we drop in an age of vast automated production, contemporary theorists like David Graeber and Juliet Schor, dissecting "work, while others starve for lack of work? Where is the leisure society that was promised? This collection includes contributions from luminaries of the past such as William Morris and Bertrand Russell, Why Work? is a provocative collection of essays and illustrations by writers and artists from the 19th century through to today

A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impress upon men’s thoughts and opinions.

## The Pin Factory

> [!Annotation|#5fb236]+ Thought Experiment - The Pin Factory
> Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day.
> 
> Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins as before. But the world does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before.
> 
> But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work.
> 
> There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness.
> 
> Can anything more insane be imagined? (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35P8UAX5?page=15&annotation=BUEBAT2G).)

While Russell frames this in terms of your labor time, we can also re-frame this in terms of ecological limits. For instance, we might ask:

> Are there material and ecological limits to a global economic system that needs non-stop annual growth of 3%?
