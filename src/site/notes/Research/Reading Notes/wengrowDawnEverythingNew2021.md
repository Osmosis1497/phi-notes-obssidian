> [!quote] Issue of describing time periods  
> Even in the Maya case, to describe the entire period between AD 900 and 1520 as ‘Post-Classic’ is to suggest that the only really significant thing about it is the degree to which it can be seen as the waning of a Golden Age. In a similar way, terms like ‘Protopalatial Crete’, ‘Pre dynastic Egypt’ or ‘Formative Peru’ convey a sense of impatience, as if Minoans, Egyptians or Andean peoples spent centuries doing little but laying the groundwork for such a Golden Age – and, it is implied, for strong, stable government to come about.33 We’ve al ready seen how this played out in Uruk, where at least seven centuries of collective self-rule (also termed ‘Predynastic’ in earlier scholarship) comes to be writ ten off as a mere prelude to the ‘real’ history of Mesopotamia – which is then presented as a his tory of conquerors, dynasts, law givers and kings.
