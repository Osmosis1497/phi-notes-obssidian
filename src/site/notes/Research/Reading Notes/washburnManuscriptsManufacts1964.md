> The important distinction is not between the written word and the material object but between the specific fact and the general idea. The specific fact may be either in the form of a written document—a manuscript—or a material artifact or "manufact" (if I may be permitted to use an archaic term to demonstrate the close relationship of the artifact and the manuscript)

> Manufacts have continued to be produced since the invention of writing and can be "read" in the absence of, or in conjunction with, manuscripts.

> rs are interpreters of manufacts. These individuals often know many nonwritten "languages" (which are nevertheless means of expression) through their knowledge of the different classes, properties, and histories of manufacts, just as the traditional scholar knows many written languages that lead to an understanding of the varied manuscripts with which he deals.

> th of these vehicles of expression—manuscripts and manufacts. Often, manuscripts must play a role subordinate to manufacts in the process of gaining and communicating knowledge. A manuscript describing the dimensions and price of a certain object can be invaluable to the museum scholar attempting to document a piece in his collections, but it can never express in its own right the beauty or ugliness of the piece. This can be "read" only in the piece itself by a mind trained to discriminate in these matters.

> How forceful in revealing the tastes and characters of the Presidents and their wives is the china selected for use in the White House! One has only to glance at the examples in the Smithsonian's collection to perceive the grace and dignity of the china of President Washington and some other early Presidents, the unabashed experimentation of some of the late nineteenth-century china, and the cold formality of most of the twentieth-century china. Words cannot tell the story so well as the mute plates do
