> This foresight of Nature to equip her creation with hidden inner furnishings against all sorts of future circumstances in order that it be preserved and suited to the variety of climate or soil, is worthy of all wonder; and in the course of wanderings and transplantations of animals and plants it seems to produce new sorts which, however, are noth­ ing more than deviations and races of one and the same genus, whose germs and natural dispositions have merely developed appropriately at long periods in various ways.

> For the red-brown appears to be suited (an effect of the atmospheric acids) as well to the cold climate as olive-brown (as an effect of the alkaline-bilious condition of the juices) to the hot; to say nothing of the temperament of the Americans; which temperament be­ trays a half-extinguished body-force, which can most naturally be looked upon as the effect of a cold world-region.
