> igor and innovation. The name ofthe city is derived from the Sindhi language and is commonly written "Mohenjo-daro." Some claim that this implies a connection to Mohan, the Hindu divinity, one of the avatars of Krishna.l Sorley believes that it should be written "Muyan-jo-Daro" or "Moenjo-Daro," moen or muyan being the inflected, objective plurals ofthe past participles ofthe verb maran, "to die." Muo, the singular form, means "the dead man." Daro is the Sindhi word for "mound" or "heap." The Sindhis clearly intend to convey "Mound of the Dead Men" when they refer to the ancient city, and this is "Moenjo-daro" in their language. The revised spelling of Mohenjo-daro as "Moenjodaro" is widespread and perfectly appropriate.
