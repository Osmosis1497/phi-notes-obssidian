> Debts were a structural factor in the lives of peasants throughout the ancient world. In Archaic Greece, Solon of Athens took the unique measure to cancel all debts, abolish debt slavery, and bring back those individuals who had been sold abroad. For this innovation, he drew on the tradition of periodic debt remission and liberation of debt slaves by royal decree in the empires of ancient Mesopotamia, about which he may have heard during his travels in the East. His poems about his legal reforms also display striking similarities with Near Eastern, and specifically Neo-Assyrian, official memorials. In contrast to debt slavery in the Near East, the practice at Athens was terminated forever, even though the custom of debt remission failed to become entrenched.

>Our closest primary evidence for Solon and the time for the seisachtheia consists, on the one hand, of the poetry ascribed to him and collected into a more or less fixed corpus in the 4th century b.c.,10 and on the other, of two 4th-century authors on the history of Athens—the author of the Athenaion Politeia and Androtion of Gargettos (FGrH 324)—who reported on vocabulary and practices that were obsolete by their time of writing.

>robably led astray by the same names used for weights of silver in Solon’s day as for later Athenian coinage, both authors apparently mistook the mina and the drachma in the accounts about Solon to be coined money (νόμισμα), even though this did not yet exist at Athens in his lifetime.

>The writer of the Athenaion Politeia, on the other hand, treats the seisachtheia as a distinct measure, separate from the change in standards, and a majority of later historians, biographers, and lexicographers have followed suit. With slight variations, they all attest that the seisachtheia entailed the ἀποκοπὴ χρεῶν, which is the regular expression in the Classical era for the cancellation of debts, to which the Athenaion Politeia (6.1) adds “both private and public” debts and “since by means of it they shook off the weight lying on them” to clarify this exceptional word.17 (p [7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=7&annotation=73EDH4YR).)

>Debt bondage entailed a status between slave and free, of which some cases are attested even in Classical Athens, but no clear distinction in Greek law generally existed between debt bondage and debt slavery.27 (p [10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=10&annotation=YHE89ZWJ).)

>[!Annotation|#5fb236]+ 
>sharp legal and/or semantic distinctions made by lexicographers and legal historians between “slave” and “servant” and other forms of servitude do not hold for early Greece. Labor, not counting chattel slaves and hired labor, “was essentially dependent labor—clients, helots, pelatai or whatever else they were called—and debt-bondsmen.”28 The “harsh laws on debt” led to debt bondage specifically when debts were incurred between members of different classes, gradually leading the poor into a slave-like condition, which the wealthy could actually create to obtain cheap (forced) labor. (p [11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=11&annotation=SQFEPZX2).)

>[!Annotation|#2ea8e5]+ 
>Solon’s seisachtheia, according to Finley, consisted of three steps: “(1) he abolished the status of hektemoros; (2) he brought back, in so far as he could, Athenians who had been sold abroad under the law, the agogimoi, among whom were defaulting hektemoroi; (3) he cancelled existing debts and prohibited debts on the person in the future, thereby freeing the debt bondsmen of his day and abolishing the category from Athens henceforth.”29 (p [11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=11&annotation=V3N73CMB).)

>In the entire region, the majority of the population consisted of peasants around subsistence level and small farmers, with varying degrees of freedom and obligation.48 Lending and borrowing, incurring debts, and owing obligations in return—in sum, the daily reciprocity of goods and services among neighboring people—was, and in many areas still is, the bedrock of their lives.49 (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=15&annotation=AJGG5WMV).)

>[!Annotation|#ff6666]+ 
>even when there is no drought or other calamity, such peasants always incur debts: for example, for their daily agricultural practice (through borrowing tools, sowing material, or acquiring livestock), or for occasions such as a marriage feast, a dowry, or a religious obligation.50 (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=15&annotation=HJ2LU8HU).)

>[!Annotation|a28ae5]+ 
>Debt does not usually lead to a loan directly on the person of the farmer, but instead he is forced first to mortgage his property, such as tools or lands, then next to hand over his children and wife to become part of the indebted labor force, and finally himself, resulting in the total dependence of all on the creditor. (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=8UPCHPQ6).)

>[!Annotation|#5fb236]+ 
>Creditors were allowed to actively seek out possibilities to bring such debtors into continuous, absolute dependency, and they were often backed by laws of contract of which the debtors were ignorant and against which they were at any rate powerless, since virtually all were illiterate and did not know their rights.51 (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=WPPI7HU4).)

>[!Annotation|#ffd400]+ 
>it is particularly striking that in many present-day cases the boundary between debt bondage and debt slavery is in fact nonexistent. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other institutions engaged with the problem estimate the number of debt slaves nowadays at 35.8 million globally, with the highest concentration in Mauritania, Qatar, and India. The term “slavery” is not used for their condition merely as a metaphor; it is exactly what it is. (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=4SL2Z3UE).)

>[!Annotation|#a28ae5]+ 
>Formally, slavery is abolished by law in the entire world, and the legally enforceable duty to pay back contracted loans would seem something essentially different from debt slavery. In reality, however, the necessity for these peasants to repay with their own labor and the absence of viable alternatives bring them into a condition of permanent debt bondage that equals slavery, including the transfer of individuals to other employers indistinguishable from sale, when creditors more powerful than they, intent on making money, are able to get away with it.

>Only intervention by the state or international agencies by means of law and coercion can effectively put an end to such practices; even so, the victims often fall back into the same traps due to their lack of alternatives.52 In other words, even when laws draw a line between free, however bonded, and slave, such laws have little value if they can be willfully ignored with impunity.

>The available evidence shows increasing debts and the resulting social and political conflicts in many Greek poleis in the course of the 7th century b.c. Debt was surely a problem for peasants paying rising rents for the land they worked, while for (small) freeholders the risks of agricultural livelihood were aggravated by the Greek system of partible inheritance. With more than one son in the family, the plot of land was partitioned equally among the heirs, thus diminishing in size and value with every successive generation. Hesiod (Op. 376–378) recommended having only one son, who in his turn would have only one son, but such wishful thinking is far removed from demographic reality.

>A particularly interesting case is the palintokia at Megara, known only from a later report by Plutarch (Quaest. Graec. 18 [Mor. 295d]; cf. 304e). Sometime after the expulsion of the tyrant Theagenes, according to Plutarch, the poor forced the elite to enact a law that made the creditors pay back the tokos (τόκος) that they, the poor, had paid to them. Tokos is usually translated as “interest,” and to go by this story, the most intense hatred was directed against it, while the law still provided no solution to the underlying debt problem.57 (p [18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=18&annotation=Z7M35SCM).)

>Diodoros, probably following the account of Hekataios asserts that when Solon was in Egypt he learned from the priests about a law of the pharaoh Bocchoris (Bakenranef, ca. 726–720), which held that loans and debts were to be made only on a person’s lands, not on his body, since people’s bodies belonged to the “state” (Diod. Sic. 1.65, 79.3–4 = Hekataios of Abdera [ca. 322], FGrH 264 F25). This particular scenario is highly implausible. The evidence for Bakenranef ’s law, which does not even mention cancellation of debts, is extremely weak.61 The presence of Athenians in Egypt as early as 600 b.c. can probably also be ruled out, since initially a prolonged stay there appears to have been granted only to Greeks associated with Lydia.62 (p [19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=19&annotation=C2ZCVWFH).)

In the early 6th century b.c., King Zedekiah of Judah decreed a d erōr in order to release enslaved members of the Judean community; when the slaveholders forced those they had released back into slavery, the prophet Jeremiah announced that as punishment for their transgression, God would “release” the people of Judah to the advancing Babylonian army ( Jer. 34:8–22). A century and a half later, Nehemiah could graft upon that long tradition his efforts to reclaim bond slaves from abroad and to reform the Judean elite in the process.8 (p [26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=26&annotation=QWBZ2MCF).)

Their ties with nongroup members are by definition weak compared to those within the group itself, and they can therefore function as “bridges” that guide ideas from one group to the other.97 (p [29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=29&annotation=I6QFZU5M).)

With the advancement of their career, they must have become so familiar with, and progressively “self-indoctrinated” by, the recurring imagery and stock phrases that formed the building blocks of the annals that they could recite such passages by heart.105 Inscriptions on palace walls, such as Sargon’s Great Display Inscription, guided visitors toward the throne room and were thus accessible to all palace attendants, emissaries, tribute-bringers, and other guests who were either cuneiform-literate or arranged for someone to translate the texts for them.106 (p [31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=31&annotation=QP8FQQBH).)

>From the first moments of political interaction between Assyria and the Jewish kingdoms, diplomatic emissaries were able to familiarize themselves with typical Assyrian phraseology through visits to the palaces at Khorsabad, Nimrud, and Nineveh, audiences with Assyrian personnel in neighboring regions, and messages from the king read aloud in their own cities by royal officials.111 (p [32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=32&annotation=JWSEKSM2).)

>in annexed states like Israel, the Assyrians established numerous administrative centers in provincial capitals and along major trade routes, such as the abovementioned coastal highway. These centers employed Assyrian scribes who mastered both Aramaic and Akkadian as well as deportees from Babylonia who were settled there.113 Both groups will have been able to translate the stelai to educated locals and even, as the years went by, to teach locals to compose letters, legal contracts, and administrative records in cuneiform, as required for their dealings with the Assyrian authorities.

>Between the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 b.c.), when Isaiah was already able to paraphrase Assyrian literature, and the fall of Harran in 609 b.c., several generations of educated local officials, scholars, and businessmen in harbor towns and provincial capitals not only spoke Aramaic with their foreign contacts, but also possessed at least some basic knowledge of the cuneiform script, and had an impression of the literary style of the Assyrian court scribes. That multilingual world—which for more than a century had been closely interconnected through trade networks and a tightly knit imperial administration—had only very recently seen the collapse of the official infrastructure when Solon traveled there (p [32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=32&annotation=9IFYJ2NS).)

>The most prominent and long-standing of these measures were the regular debt remissions and liberations of debt slaves by royal decrees issued by the kings of the Mesopotamian empires. Theirs was a focused, single responsibility toward the gods for justice in their realm, and the debt remissions were embedded in the concomitant ideology of the king’s duties, piety, and power.

>In ancient Greece, the situation of the peasants seems to have deteriorated in the 7th century b.c. due to increasing pressure by the landowning elite, spurred on by a highly competitive lifestyle. Various countermovements against the problems of debt are reported, but Solon is the only Archaic lawgiver known to have canceled by law all existing agricultural debts. He was following the example of the Mesopotamian remission decrees, but he also went beyond that model by abolishing debt slavery. In Granovetter’s terms, the elite of Archaic Athens appears as a community with “strong ties,” among whom Solon introduced the idea of debt cancellation and termination of debt slavery from the Near East, acting as a “bridge” due to his “weak ties” with informants familiar with the tradition of (an)durāru. His measures were a legal innovation that he could introduce due to the special powers granted him.115 (p [33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=33&annotation=MYJTKT3R).)

It apparently concerned only agricultural debts, like the decrees in Mesopotamia, and the sources recount the discontent of the elite who lost their outstanding credit, as well as the disappointment of the poor that the land was not subsequently redistributed (Ath. Pol. 11–12; Plut. Sol. 16). (p [33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=33&annotation=KL7I2ZFG).)

>Apparently, abolition of slavery of Athenians, unlike the cancellation of debts, was supported by a majority in the polis, and from this fact we may tentatively infer that this measure could draw on existing values. To implement and solidify the legal termination of debt slavery, moreover, Solon’s institution of the popular court must have been vital; at least complaints could be filed there, with some hope of success, against those who attempted to pressure debtors into undue degrees of servitude (p [35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=35&annotation=9XZRCKGR).)
