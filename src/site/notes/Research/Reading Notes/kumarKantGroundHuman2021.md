## Abstract
> Kant interpreters have contrasting views on what Kant takes to be the basis for human dignity. Several commentators have argued that human dignity can be traced back to some feature of human beings. Others contend that humans in themselves lack dignity, but dignity can be attributed to them because the moral law demands respect for humanity. I argue, alternatively, that human dignity in Kant’s system can be seen to be grounded in the reciprocal relationship between the dignity of the moral law and the dignity inherent in the human constitution. The latter includes the dignity of personhood, construed as rational inner purposiveness, and the dignity of giving oneself the law and striving to follow it.## Citekey

> Korsgaard argues regressively that the capacity of humans to set an end based on what is valuable to them makes humanity a ‘source of value’ (1996: pp. ix–x), and enables humans to conceive of themselves as having dignity (272–3). Similarly, Wood (2008: 92) argues that our ‘basic act’ as rational (human) beings is the ‘act of setting ends and regarding them as good’, which ‘necessitates our representing ourselves as already ends [i.e., as having dignity]’.

> Allison (2011: 210, 218) takes the capacity for morality as the ‘property’ that makes humanity an end in itself. Here the capacity for morality is the ‘capacity to recognize and obey the categorical imperative’ (207 n.), and only means that humans must stand under moral laws – i.e. can recognize and obey CI – not that they actually obey them (218).

> Kant views the human person in two different senses: the empirically observable person comprising both sensibility and rationality (henceforth Person1); and the same person regarded only in its rational, and not sensible, aspect (Person2).

> Kant ascribes dignity to Person2,notPerson1. He says that, as homo phenomenon, human beings have ‘ordinary value’ like animals (Person1), but construed as homo noumenon, or ‘person ::: as the subject of morally practical reason’ (Person2), humans are ‘exalted beyond price’, and have ‘dignity (an absolute inner worth)’ (MdS, 6: 434–5; also 439 n.).

> In sum: Person1 is the sensible-cum-rational human person possessing only ordinary value. Person2 is the rational-moral aspect of Person1, or the humanity in Person1. Unlike Person1, Person2 can be put under obligation and has dignity.
