> Sagard described the offering of a domestic cat to a Huron sachem in 1620s: This present gave him infinite pleasure and he made much of it; but when he saw that the cat came to us when we called it he concluded that it was possessed of reason and understood all that we said to it. Therefore, after having humbly thanked me for so rare a gift, he begged us to tell this cat that when it should be in his land it must not behave badly nor be running into the other lodges nor in the woods, but remain always in his abode to eat the mice, and that he would love it as his own son and not let it be in want of anything (Sagard 1939:270).
