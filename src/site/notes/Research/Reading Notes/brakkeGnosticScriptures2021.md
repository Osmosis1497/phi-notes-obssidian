> Scripture (“writing”)—in the general sense of the word—means a body of written religious literature that members of a religion or group consider authoritative in matters such as belief, conduct, rhetoric, or the running of practical affairs. Scripture often contains a system of symbols within which readers can orient themselves and make sense of their relationship to the world, the divine, and other people. Such a system is sometimes expressed in story form and is then technically called myth. Sometimes it also tells where the religion and its members came from and explains why they are distinct and special.

> Furthermore, it reflected the different philosophies and symbolic systems on which the writers might base their religious thought (Platonism, Jewish apocalyptic, etc.). In the range of possibilities that ancient Christian theologians actually hit upon, some of the results will now seem familiar to the modern reader, while others seem bizarre. Gnostic scripture belongs to this second category, the bizarre

> Finally, gnostic scripture now seems strange because it rebels against important beliefs shared by many early Christians and their Jewish predecessors, beliefs which even now belong to the core of ordinary Western Judaism and Christianity—especially belief in the goodness and omnipotence of the Creator: gnostics believed that Satan made the world.

> In modern parlance, a list of the fully authoritative scripture read by a particular group or religion is called its canon (“yardstick”) of scripture. Modern Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, for example, officially accept the books of the Old Testament, taken from Judaism, and twenty-seven books of Christian scripture (the New Testament) as their canon of scripture. Although there is still no full agreement on the exact contents (Catholics and Protestants politely disagree over some fifteen books and parts of books in the Old Testament), the outlines of the main modern Western Christian canon were already being draw

> [!quote] Highlight  
> What is first and foremost in gnostic scripture is its doctrines and its interpretation of Old and New Testament books—especially its open hostility to the god of Israel and its views on resurrection, the reality of Jesus’ incarnation and suffering, and the universality of Christian salvation. But also, gnostic scripture is distinctive because the gnostic myth competes strongly with the book of Genesis, thus rivaling the basic system used by other Christians to orient themselves to the world, the divine, and other people. On these points, the gap between gnostic religion and proto-orthodox Christianity was vast.

> By the middle of the fourth century, gnostic Christianity (apart from its Valentinian branch) was known by several different names, perhaps indicating that it had split into denominations: “Archontics” (from arkhōn, “heavenly ruler”), “Sethians,” “Barbēlites,” etc.; see EpG 25.2.1, 26.3.7.

> As a mere word, the Greek term gnōstikos goes back as far as the time of Plato. It was a rare technical word with philosophical overtones; it meant something like “leading to knowledge” or “capable of attaining knowledge.”

> In normal usage the term was never applied to human beings; that is to say, normally a person would not be called “gnostic.” Rather, the word “gnostic” regularly referred to disciplines of study, human faculties, capacities, and the like.

> Gnostic scripture describes the salvation of the individual by the Greek word gnōsis, and the self-given name of the “gnostic” sect refers to their ability to attain gnōsis.

> The other kind of knowing is personal acquaintance with an object, often a person (“I know Athens well”; “I have known Susan for many years”). In Greek the word for this is gignōskein (French connaître),1 and in English one can call this kind of knowledge “acquaintance.” The corresponding Greek noun is gnōsis. If, for example, two people have been introduced to one another, each one can claim to have gnōsis or acquaintance of the other. If one is introduced to god, one has gnōsis of god. The ancient gnostics described salvation as a kind of gnōsis or acquaintance, and the ultimate object of that acquaintance was nothing less than god.
