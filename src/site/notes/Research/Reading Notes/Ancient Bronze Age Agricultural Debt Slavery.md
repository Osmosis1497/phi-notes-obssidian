## Ancient Bronze Age Agricultural Debt Slavery

> [!Annotation|#a28ae5]+
> The rich evidence from the ancient Near East, Egypt, and the Hebrew Bible tells us, in greater detail than the Greek evidence, how the cycle from indebtedness to debt bondage and debt slavery developed. (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=15&annotation=26F43B23).)

> In the entire region, the majority of the population consisted of peasants around subsistence level and small farmers, with varying degrees of freedom and obligation.48 Lending and borrowing, incurring debts, and owing obligations in return—in sum, the daily reciprocity of goods and services among neighboring people—was, and in many areas still is, the bedrock of their lives.49 (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=15&annotation=AJGG5WMV).)

> [!Annotation|#ff6666]+
> even when there is no drought or other calamity, such peasants always incur debts: for example, for their daily agricultural practice (through borrowing tools, sowing material, or acquiring livestock), or for occasions such as a marriage feast, a dowry, or a religious obligation.50 (p [15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=15&annotation=HJ2LU8HU).)

> [!Annotation|#5fb236]+
> When tenancy of farmlands is held on the obligation to requite with produce, money, labor, or military service, reserves are even sooner exhausted and peasants become incurably indebted to wealthier landowners or rent farmers. (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=Y7XFARZ3).)

> [!Annotation|#a28ae5]+
> Debt does not usually lead to a loan directly on the person of the farmer, but instead he is forced first to mortgage his property, such as tools or lands, then next to hand over his children and wife to become part of the indebted labor force, and finally himself, resulting in the total dependence of all on the creditor. (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=8UPCHPQ6).)

> [!Annotation|#5fb236]+
> Creditors were allowed to actively seek out possibilities to bring such debtors into continuous, absolute dependency, and they were often backed by laws of contract of which the debtors were ignorant and against which they were at any rate powerless, since virtually all were illiterate and did not know their rights.51 (p [16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3FZ7D2A?page=16&annotation=WPPI7HU4).)
