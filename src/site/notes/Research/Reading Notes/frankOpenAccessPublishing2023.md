> - **Abstract:** For two decades, the international scholarly publishing community has been embroiled in a divisive debate about the best model for funding the dissemination of scientific research. Some may assume that this debate has been thoroughly resolved in favour of the Open Access (OA) model of scientific publishing. Recent commentaries reveal a less settled reality. This narrative review aims to lay out the nature of these deep divisions among the sector's stakeholders, reflects on their systemic drivers and considers the future prospects for actualising OA's intended benefits and surmounting its risks and costs. In the process, we highlight some of inequities OA presents for junior or unfunded researchers, and academics from resource-poor environments, for whom an increasing body of evidence shows clear evidence of discrimination and injustice caused by Article Processing Charges. The authors are university-appointed researchers working the UK and South Africa, trained in disciplines ranging from medicine and epidemiology to social science and digital science. We have no vested interest in any particular model of scientific publication, and no conflicts of interest to declare. We believe the issues we identify are pertinent to almost all research disciplines.

> The OA model uses Article Processing Charges (APC), paid to pub lishers at the time of publicationby researchers, their institutions and/or funders. These APC – typically $1500-$2500 per article, but sometimes much more for prestigious journals (Morrison, 2019) – are intended to replace journal subscription fees, and paywall charges for reprints for non-subscribers.

> Despite continuing growth in the number of scholarly papers published in Open Access journals (Piwowar et al., 2018), the balance of advantages and disadvantages of OA have been rather difficult to discern over the two decades since OA was launched (Gray, 2020; MacLeavy et al., 2020).

> Because the literature on OA is so widely scattered across scientific disciplines and their respectivejournals, it is very difficultto find a set of truly comprehensive search terms which sensitively identify all relevant publications.
