# Notes

Definition of [Structural] Violence: 
> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6QT5LM6M?page=105&annotation=CLHQGRW2)“By “violence” here, I am not referring to the kind of occasional, spectacular acts of violence that we tend to think of first when the word is invoked, but again, the boring, humdrum, yet omnipresent forms of structural violence that define the very conditions of our existence, the subtle or not-so-subtle threats of physical force that lie behind everything from enforcing rules about where one is allowed to sit or stand or eat or drink in parks or other public places, to the threats or physical intimidations or attacks that underpin the enforcement of tacit gender norms.” ([Graeber, 2012, p. 106](zotero://select/library/items/EASIZ8BY))

- Places where the treat of violence is both hidden away as well as underwriting and shaping the public transcript.

Even when forms are complex, even bafflingly complex, it’s by an endless accretion of very simple yet apparently contradictory components, like a maze made out the endless juxtaposition of two or three very simple geometrical elements. And like a maze, it doesn’t really open on anything outside itself. As a result, there just isn’t very much to interpret. A Geertzian “thick description” of a mortgage application, for example, would not really be possible, no matter how dense the document.” ([Graeber, 2012, p. 109](zotero://select/library/items/EASIZ8BY))

Even if some defiant soul set out to write one just to prove it could be done, it would be even harder to imagine anyone actually reading it.” ([Graeber, 2012, p. 109](zotero://select/library/items/EASIZ8BY))
