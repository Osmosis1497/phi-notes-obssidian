> Secondly, the alignment of linguistics and archaeology in the long period between the ****Yamnaya**-horizon** in the Pontic–Caspian steppes and the emergence of the separate IndoEuropean branches, such as the Indo-Iranians or the Celts, is only possible if we have a grasp of the disintegration of language family, or in other words which branches belong most intimately together, going back to a common node in the family tree (cf. Olander 2018).
