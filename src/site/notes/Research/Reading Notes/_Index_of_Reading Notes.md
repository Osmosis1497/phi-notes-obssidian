# To Create or Update Reading Notes
To import or update a reading note with annotations made in Zotero, 
1. run the following command:
> "insert markdown zotero"
2. enter in the citation info in the zotero input box

A new note will be created in this folder.  You can use the same command to update the note with more recent annotations.  I do not think annotations flow in the other direction.

# Contents
*Some of these are published, some are not. All are titled by a auto-generated citation key.  Full citation and selected annotations are found behind each link.
